##### This graph shows that as you grow older, your physical activity (not counting daily work) increases. Given that heart disease is most common in people of ages 65 and older, it can be inferred that older people exercise more regularly in order to prevent the risk of heart disease.

##### This graph summarizes the percentage of people from each age group that were surveyed for this dataset. As shown, younger age groups are less represented than older groups, which prevents us from seeing more of the effects of environment and lifestyle relating to heart disease on the younger generation. Just because there is a lack of information on younger people does not mean that they are not at risk of contracting heart disease. Everyone must take care of their own health.

##### This graph shows the close relationship between mental and physical health. Both increase and decrease together. This information suggests that the causes of mental and physical health may be similar, which could also mean that treatments could be similar as well.  

#

### Summary: The representation of people surveyed is unequal, but the data shows many important and accurate trends, which makes it worth exploring.

## How Heart Disease Can Affect Your Life

```




    
![png](HeartDisease_files/HeartDisease_13_0.png)
    



##### Physical Health is described as how many days in the past 30 days were they ill or injured.  People that have heart disease have lower Mental Health but still, have good Physical Health.  Those who do not have heart disease have a higher Mental Health but have a lower Physical Health.  Avoiding Heart Disease is key to having good Mental and Physical Health.  Having good Physical Health can lead to better Mental Health.

##### People that have a higher BMI are more at risk of getting heart disease than people with a lower BMI.  Maintaining a low BMI is essential to preventing heart disease.

    BMI_avg[i] /= count

![png](HeartDisease_files/HeartDisease_17_0.png)
    



##### This bar chart is showing the average Body Mass Index \(BMI\) for each Age Category.  A healthy BMI is between 18.5 to 24.9. The ages where the BMI is the highest is when most people are in the workforce and do not have as much time to exercise to reduce their BMI.  As they get older and are retired, they have more time to exercise and reduce their BMI. 



#

#### As you can see from the above charts, having a high BMI increases the chances of you getting heart disease.

##### This bar graph represents the amount of people with and without diabetes that have heart disease. As shown, the number of people who have diabetes and heart disease is much less than those who have don't have diabetes but have heart disease, suggesting that there isn't much correlation between the two conditions. In this dataset, 9% , or about 27.4 thousand were found to have heart disease, and about 13%, or 43.3 thousand people in this dataset were found to have diabetes. Within the whole population, about 9 thousand people out of the 320 thousand people in the dataset have both diabetes and heart disease.

##### This visual shows the number of days  that people with and without heart disease had poor mental health in 30 days. As seen, those who have heart disease tend to experience more days where their mental health is not good.

```




    
![png](HeartDisease_files/HeartDisease_26_0.png)
    



##### This visual represents the physical health people with and without heart disease have. The physical health of a person is measured by the number of days in the past 30 where the person felt that they weren't in good physical health. This graph shows that people with heart disease tend to have worse physical health as compared to those who don't.

```




    
![png](HeartDisease_files/HeartDisease_28_0.png)
    



##### This visual represents the amount of sleep that people with and without heart disease get. Since, the value is the same, this visual shows that there isn't a significant difference between the amount of sleep that people with and without heart disease get. This visual also shows us that the average amount of sleep for people is about 7 hours.

## Smoking and Heart Disease




```
data = [58.59, 41.41]
labels = ["Smokers", "Non-Smokers"]

colors = sns.color_palette('pastel')[0:2]
plt.pie(data, labels = labels, colors = colors, autopct='%.0f%%')
plt.title("Percentage of Smokers in people with Heart Disease")
plt.show()
```




    
![png](HeartDisease_files/HeartDisease_33_0.png)
    



##### This pie chart shows the percentage of people <u>with</u> Heart Disease who are smokers and non\-smokers. The chart shows that the majority of people with Heart Disease are smokers meaning smoking may have negative effects on a person's health that could lead to a higher risk of Heart Disease.




```
data = [39.62, 60.38]
labels = ["Smokers", "Non_Smokers"]

colors = sns.color_palette('pastel')[0:2]
plt.pie(data, labels = labels, colors = colors, autopct='%.0f%%')
plt.title("Percentage of Smokers in people without Heart Disease")
plt.show()
```




    
![png](HeartDisease_files/HeartDisease_35_0.png)
    



##### This pie chart shows the percentage of people <u>without</u> Heart Disease who are smokers and non\-smokers. A majority of people without Heart Disease are non\-smokers and combined with the earlier pie chart shows that smoking would have a definite impact on the chances of Heart Disease.



##



### With the data showing a clear correlation between smoking and a higher risk of Heart Disease, people should now consider all the health problems already associated with smoking and add on the higher risk of Heart Disease, before deciding to smoke.

## Alcohol and its Effects on Heart Disease




```
data = [4.17, 95.83]
labels = ["Alcoholics", "Non-Alcoholics"]

colors = sns.color_palette('pastel')[2:4]
plt.pie(data, labels = labels, colors = colors, autopct='%.0f%%')
plt.title("Percentage of People with Heart Disease that are Alcoholic VS Non-Alcoholic")
plt.show()
```




    
![png](HeartDisease_files/HeartDisease_42_0.png)
    



##### The chart depicts people within the dataset that have heart disease. Of those people with heart disease, 4% are alcoholic.


```
data = [7.06, 92.94]
labels = ["Alcoholic", "Non-Alcoholic"]

colors = sns.color_palette('pastel')[2:4]
plt.pie(data, labels = labels, colors = colors, autopct='%.0f%%')
plt.title("Percentage of People with Heart Disease that are Alcoholic VS Non-Alcoholic")
plt.show()
```




    
![png](HeartDisease_files/HeartDisease_44_0.png)
    



##### This chart depicts people within the dataset that do not have heart disease. Of those people, 7% are alcoholic.



### By observing the first chart, it can be inferred that alcohol does not have a direct effect on a person's chance to have heart disease, as an overwhelming majority that do have heart disease are not heavy drinkers. However, the second chart demonstrates that of those without heart disease, very are not heavy drinkers either. Essentially, there is an imbalance of collected data on alcoholism, and its effects on heart disease are uncertain.



### Although the presented data depicts otherwise, it is a scientific consensus that heavy drinking can lead to heart failure. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \(CDC\) states that heavy drinking can lead to cardiovascular problems such as increased blood pressure and heart disease.
